The screenshot of the result is hard to capture because the results are a lot
and it takes hours to generate so that I stored terminal results into the local 
txt files in the folder of DATA_RESULT_FINAL. In side of folder, you can find
ExperimentType_StaringPoint_Enviroment for example TCP_100_Local.txt is the
TCP experiment staring with 100 and running on local host OS. The result is 
explained by Netperfl0*.gif. The result.xlsx is the excel files that we used to
plot the graph.
